#### Adding Events

```js
voice.addEvent(PlayerEvents.eventName);
```

#### List of Events

- `trackStart` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track starts. 
- `trackEnd` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track ends.
- `queueStart` &rarr; Emitted whenever a queue starts.
- `queueEnd` &rarr; Emitted whenever a queue ends.
- `audioError` &rarr; Emitted whenever a audio error occurs.
- `trackPause` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track pauses.
- `trackResume` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track resumes.

### Using Events

```js
/* Ensure you have loader defined using the LoadCommands class
const { AoiClient, LoadCommands } = require("aoi.js");
const loader = new LoadCommands(bot); */

loader.load(voice.cmds,"./voice/");
```

This should be the content of your `./voice/<filename>.js`:

```js
module.exports = [{
    channel: "$channelID",
    type: "eventName",
    code: `code to execute here`
}]
```

If you don't want to use handlers, you can use this instead in your main file also known as `index.js`:

```js
voice.cmds["eventName"].set("name of the command", {
    channel: "$channelID",
    code: `code to execute here`
});
```
